# kqwait

Waits for write, rename and delete events on files and file creation and
deletion events in directories and returns. Please note, that simply 
touching a file will not trigger a return.

Supports waiting on multiple files and directories.  When waiting on a
directory, adding a file, or deleting a file will trigger a return.
Everything else (like touching or writing) will not trigger a return.

This tool is inspired by [inotifywait][1], the original [kqueue
paper][2], and the lack of anything similar (to the best of my
knowledge) on Mac OS X.

## Requirements

### Mac OS X

 - Xcode (Command Line Tools suffice)

### Linux

 - http://mark.heily.com/libkqueue/

Waiting on directories does not work on Linux at the moment.

## Build

To build this just type:

    make

If you want to check that everything is working correctly on your
machine use:

    make test

This requires perl, with modules `IPC::Run` and `Test::More` installed. 

## Usage

Call it like this:

    kqwait [-d] [-v] [-h] <file|dir>[ <file|dir>]+

### Options

 - `d` - enable debug output on stderr
 - `v` - print version and exit
 - `h` - print help

### Operation

The tool prints the file or directory that caused the tool to wake up,
and returns `0`, if the expected event occured, `1` otherwise.

When waiting on a directory, a `+` character is prepended if a file was
added, a `-` if a file was deleted.

Use it in a shell script like this:

    while ./kqwait text.txt; do
       # do some stuff on write
    done

Or watch directories like this:

    $ while ./kqwait somedir someotherdir; do true; done
    + somedir/a_file_was_added.txt
    - someotherdir/a_file_was_deleted.txt

*When watching directories, write events concerning existing files
currently won't trigger a return.* Only creation and deletion will do
that. If you would like to track all events at the same time you can use
shell mechanisms to do that:

    while ./kqwait dir1/ dir1/*; do
      # something
    done

If you want to use the file that caused the return, you can assign the
output to a variable:

    while file=`./kqwait dir1/`; do
      echo "Event on $file"
    done

See a more advanced script, that does some simple dispatch based on file
ending under `samples/`.

## Note

There is (at least) one race condition in this code, when waiting
for changes on directories. If several events happen on a directory
in quick succession, this tool might catch an intermediate snapshot
of that chain of events.
